# Object-Detection-using-Keras

This assignment has the following objectives:
- Combine classification and regression models for solving the multi-task problem of multi-class classification and localization
- Learn how to solve multi-task problems in Deep Learning using multiple loss minimization
- Learn to use the Functional API in TF/Keras and create a multi-branch Deep Learning model
- Learn to use transfer learning using a backbone VGG16 mode
- I used AWS for this project
